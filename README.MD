# Web API code quiz

I've created a quiz utilizing html, css, and javascript coding skills.

To access quiz launch the site in your default browser and hit "Start Quiz".

Timer should start and quetion should be displayed.

A wrong answer should result in "Wrong" being displayed at the the bottom and 10 seconds being subtracted from timer.

A right answer should result in "Correct" being displayed at the bottom with no effect to your timer.

One you finish a quiz your score will be displayed and a text box should come up for you to input your intials.

Lastly you shold be taken to another page that will display your score and previose scores entered.
